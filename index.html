                            <p>Computer science basically deals with the study of methods for processing and organizing data in computers.
                              It spans a wide range of  interrelated areas 
                              from its theoretical and algorithmic foundations to cutting-edge developments in robotics, computer vision, 
                              intelligent systems, bioinformatics, and other 
                              exciting areas.
                              It can as well be seen as the computers and computational systems which deals mostly with software systems, 
                                applications and theories.

                              It is believed to be a rooted in mathematics. 
                              It majorly focuses on the  software component of the computer as it cover the following core areas;

            <h5>Computer Graphics</h5>
            <p>Majority of the early mainframe business computers produced outputs in form of punched cards, paper tape, or text 
              printouts.However, system designers realized that some 
              kinds of data were particularly amenable to a graphical representation. In the early 1950s, the first systems using the 
              cathode ray tube (CRT) for graphics output found specialized application.For example,defense systems such as MIT Whirlwind and the 
              Air Force’s SAGE used the CRT to display information such as the location of radar targets.
              
             <div>
              <p>Modern Graphics</p>
              Modern applications (such as drawing programs and games) 
              go well beyond simple two-dimensional objects. Indeed, 
              multimedia developers typically use graphics engines 
              designed to work with C++ or Java. A graphics engine 
              provides a way to define and model 2D and 3D polygons. 
              (Curves can be constructed by specifying “control points” 
              for bicubic curves.)
            </p>
            <p>Computer graphics goes a long way in determining how  a users experience would bethis is why developers
               spend more resources on graphics in areas like gaming,multemedia,modelling application e.t.c</p>

                               <p>This consists of a database (a 
                                collection of information, usually organized into records 
                                with component fields) and facilities for adding, updating, 
                                retrieving, manipulating, and reporting on data.
                                This could be acheived with the use of programming languages such as COBOL, SQLMysql, XML, Oracle e.t.c. </p>

                           the machine  to get a specified task done?". This is the designing of user interfaces 
                           for software and machines such as web applications, mobile applications, computers, home appliances and more.

                              <p>Design standards entail understanding the client's requirements, putting the following in mind;</p>

                                databases, which enhances the user's interest in a website.</p>
                            <p>Back End Web Development involves the server-side interaction withe browser using programming languages such as

  <h5>Who is a computer science teacher?</h5>
  <P>Just like any other teacher,a computer science  teacher is an educator who helps a person (student) learn or aquire computer related skills.
    He or she is grounded in the computer science feild both theoritical and practical wise.They guide students to acheive competence by adopting various methods of learning.
    Coming to  simple terms,we say they are people who teach or impact computer science knowledge.
     </P>

     <h5>How is Computer Science Changing the world?</h5>
     <p>If there is anything that will never go unnoticed in the world today ,it is computer science.
     Back then in primary School days a teacher once asked me how can I relate the human body System to a computer. So little and timid I managed to boldly 
       table the Input,process,Output Cycle that governs the computer ,till date when I hear computer science what comes to mind is the IPO 
       cycle.
       Ahem...why the story?
       Well,in the world today information is being given out back to back ,this said output or result is as an influence of raw facts
        i.e inputs and a process called the processing must have been carrried out-where you see an IPO,you see a commputer,
        just ensure it involves an electronic medium.

        The application of Computer science is visible in virtually all areas of life ranging from health,security,food,transportation,education,finance and many more.
   Primitive methods of handling things are better acheived easier ,faster and more reliable.Errors that could be encountered in the course 
   of carry out certain activities are now minimal.<br>
  </div>
   <p style="font-style:italic;">Application Of Computer Sceince In Education</p>
   In the educational sector,learning has become enjoyable via the aid of applications like microsoft word,presentation packages,display devices like projector 
   could be used to make graphical representations of ideas that the teachers would love to inculcate.This also brings learning homeas students could make further research and even
   get shares of slides and documents;computer networking.Web applications and mobile applications are owned and managed by several learning institutions 
   to aid easy registration,transmission of information,help ,support and much more.This is just a few out of the bounty ways computer science has come through on this.

     </p>
     <p>Computer Science is a wonderful feild and we could go on for years trying to comptehend the ways roles it plays in recent time.</p>
